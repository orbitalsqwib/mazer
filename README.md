# < m a z e r >
_a simple maze game, made in python. runs on terminals with python 3.7._
## features

in < m a z e r >, you can:
- _load mazes from comma(,) delimited csv files!_
- _play through them as fast as you can!_
- _configure mazes however you want!_
- _export the currently loaded maze for your friends to try!_
- _make blank mazes and see where your creativity takes you!_
- _try it with a physical console and play it on a raspberry pi! (Needs raspbian, a sensehat, python 3.7 and also a computer connected to it to see console output)_
- _view leaderboards to check out your fastest times!_

## getting started
### prerequisites
- python 3.7
- (optimally) some command line experience

### starting the game
simply navigate to the directory where the `mazer.py` file is and run

`python3 mazer.py`

have fun!

## cool stuff
> _bored of the dreary monotone color? want a fresher experience?_

now you can change it up with color highlighting! simply head over to the `mazer.py` file and find the `highlighting` section, then change it appropriately (it works best with mac/linux terminals).

> _wondering what that weird map id is?_

by using the power of md5 hashes, all leaderboards are uniquely tied to one maze, and one maze only! now you can compete on individual mazes without worrying about cheaters!

> _cool configurations_

boost your maze editing skills with brushes, which allow you to speed up maze creation so you can get to playing them faster!
